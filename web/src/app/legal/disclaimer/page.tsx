            Financial Risk
          </h2>
          <p>
            Trading outcome shares on prediction markets is speculative and carries a
            high level of risk. The value of your positions can go up or down rapidly,
            and you may lose some or all of your deposited funds. Past performance is not
            indicative of future results.

            Cryptocurrency Volatility
          </h2>
          <p>
            The platform operates with USDC on the Base blockchain. While USDC is
            designed to maintain a stable value, cryptocurrency markets are inherently
            volatile. Network congestion, smart contract issues, or market conditions may
            affect your ability to deposit, withdraw, or trade.

            Smart Contract Risk
          </h2>
          <p>
            The platform relies on smart contracts deployed on Base.
            While these contracts have been tested, there is no guarantee they are free
            from bugs or vulnerabilities. Exploits or bugs could result in loss of funds.
